# eCommerce

"eCommerce" is a commercial website which simulates products selling on the Internet by a generic vendor. It is meant to be a university project whose main goals are developing skills in creating a back-end infrastructure for a website, along with front-end dynamically-generated webpages and user-friendly interfaces.

Features:
 - Home page
 - User signup
 - User login/logout
 - Overall browsing
 - Category browsing
 - Article research
 - Article detail page
 - User dashboard
 - User cart
 - Administration CRUD tools

Code and formatting can still be improved A LOT, though this is my very first PHP project, so be patient with me.
